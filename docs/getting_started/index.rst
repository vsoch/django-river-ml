Singularity Registry (HPC) is a tool that makes it easy to install containers as
Lmod modules. You can create your own registry entries (e.g., a specification
to pull a particular container and expose some number of entrypoints) or
the library also provides you with a community set.

If you have any questions or issues, please `let us know <https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-hpc/issues>`_
