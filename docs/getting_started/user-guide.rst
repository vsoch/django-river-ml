User Guide

Django River ML allows you to easily deploy `river <https://riverml.xyz>`_ online machine learning
for a `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ project. It is based off of `chantilly <https://github.com/online-ml/chantilly>`_ 
with hopes of having similar design. We include `example clients <https://github.com/vsoch/django-river-ml/tree/main/examples>`_ and a 
test application in `tests <https://github.com/vsoch/django-river-ml/tree/main/tests>`_.
We are excited about what you might build with this, and please
`give us a ping <https://github.com/US-RSE/usrse-python>`_. if you have a question, find a bug, or want to request a feature!
This is an open source project and we are eager for your contribution. üéâÔ∏è

Quick Start
===========

Once you have ``django-river-ml`` installed (:ref:`getting_started-installation`) you
can do basic setup.

Setup
-----

Add it to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` along with ``rest_framework``


.. code-block:: python


    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django_river_ml',
        'rest_framework',
        ...
    )


Add django-river-ml's URL patterns:

.. code-block:: python

    from django_river_ml import urls as django_river_urls
    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        url(r'^', include(django_river_urls)),
        ...
    ]


Settings
--------

It is highly recommended that you minimally set these settings in your app settings.py
and do not use the default of the plugin:

.. list-table:: Title
   :widths: 25 25 25 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ``APP_DIR``
     - $root
     - Base directory for storing secrets and cache. Defaults to the root of the module installation (recommended to change)
     - ``os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))``
   * - ``SHELVE_SECRET_KEY``
     - None
     - Secret key for shelve (if ``STORAGE_BACKEND`` set to "shelve" (will be generated if not found)
     - fgayudsiushfdsfdf
   * - ``JWT_SECRET_KEY``
     - None
     - Secret key for json web tokens (if authentication enabled, and will be generated if not found)
     - fgayudsiushfdsfdf


The following additonal settings are available to set in your ``settings.py``:


.. list-table:: Title
   :widths: 25 25 25 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Default
     - Description
     - Example
   * - ``URL_PREFIX``
     - api
     - The api prefix to use for the endpoint
     - river
   * - ``STORAGE_BACKEND``
     - shelve
     - The storage backend to use, either shelve or redis (requires redis setup)
     - redis
   * - ``REDIS_DB``
     - river-redis
     - The redis database name, only used if ``STORAGE_BACKEND`` is set to redis
     - another-name
   * - ``REDIS_HOST``
     - localhost
     - The redis host name, only used if ``STORAGE_BACKEND`` is set to redis
     - redis-container
   * - ``REDIS_PORT``
     - 6379
     - The redis port, only used if ``STORAGE_BACKEND`` is set to redis
     - 1111
   * - ``CACHE_DIR``
     - None (and then is set to ``os.path.join(APP_DIR, "cache")``)
     - The cache directory for tokens, recommended to set a custom ``APP_DIR`` and it will be a sub-directory ``cache`` there
     - /opt/cache
   * - ``DISABLE_AUTHENTICATION``
     - False
     - For views that require authentication, disable them.
     - True
   * - ``DOMAIN_URL``
     - http://127.0.0.1:8000
     - Domain used in templates, and api prefix
     - https://ml-server
   * - ``SESSION_EXPIRES_SECONDS``
     - 600
     - The number of seconds a session (upload request) is valid (10 minutes)
     - 6000
   * - ``TOKEN_EXPIRES_SECONDS``
     - 600
     - The number of seconds a token is valid (10 minutes)
     - 6000
   * - ``VIEW_RATE_LIMIT``
     - 10000/1day
     - View rate limit using django-ratelimit based on ipaddress
     - 100/1day
   * - ``VIEW_RATE_LIMIT_BLOCK``
     - True
     - Given that someone goes over, are they blocked for a period?
     - False


For more advanced settings like customizing the endpoints with authentication, see
the `settings.py <https://github.com/vsoch/django-river-ml/blob/main/django_river_ml/settings.py>`_ in the application.

Authentication
--------------

If you have ``DISABLE_AUTHENTICATION`` set to true, or you customize the settings ``AUTHENTICATED_VIEWS`` to change
the defaults, then you shouldn't need to do any kind of authentication. This might be ideal for a development or
closed environment that is only accessible to you or your team. However, for most cases you are strongly encouraged to
have authentication. Authentication will require creating a user, to which Django River ML will add a token generated
by Django Restful, if not already generated. For purposes of example, we can quickly create a user as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    python manage.py createsuperuser
    Username (leave blank to use 'dinosaur'):
    Email address: 
    Password: 
    Password (again): 
    Superuser created successfully.

And at this point, you can also ask for the token.

.. code-block:: console

    python manage.py get_token dinosaur
    Enter Password:
    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

You can then export this token in the environment to be found by the `river api client <https://github.com/vsoch/riverapi>`_.

.. code-block:: console

    export RIVER_ML_USER=dinosaur
    export RIVER_ML_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


Otherwise you will need to manually go through a standard OAuth2 workflow of using basic
auth to look for a 401 response with a ``Www-Authenticate`` header, parsing that to find the "realm" 
(the authentication server) and then making a request to that endpoint with the base64 encoded user and token 
in the Authenticate header. It's much easier to use the client to do it for you, which will cache your token
(until it expires and you need to request a new one automatically).

Of course if you have a Django interface with OAuth for login, you can make a settings
or profile page to easily retrieve the same token. Open an issue if you need guidance to do this.
We might consider adding a front-end view to provide by default if it's desired.

Sample Application
------------------

An `example app <https://github.com/vsoch/django-river-ml/tree/main/tests>`_ is provided that
you can use to test. Once you have your environment setup, you can do:


.. code-block:: console

    $ python manage.py makemigrations
    $ python manage.py migrate
    $ python manage.py runserver
    

In another terminal, you can then run a sample script:

    
.. code-block:: bash

    $ python examples/regression/run.py
    $ python examples/binary/run.py


This library is under development and we will have more endpoints and functionality
coming soon!
