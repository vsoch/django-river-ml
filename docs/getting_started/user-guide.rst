User Guide

Django River ML allows you to easily deploy `river <https://riverml.xyz>`_ online machine learning
for a `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ project. It is based off of `chantilly <https://github.com/online-ml/chantilly>`_ 
with hopes of having similar design. We include `example clients <https://github.com/vsoch/django-river-ml/tree/main/examples>`_ and a 
test application in `tests <https://github.com/vsoch/django-river-ml/tree/main/tests>`_.
We are excited about what you might build with this, and please
`give us a ping <https://github.com/vsoch/django-river-ml/issues>`_. if you have a question, find a bug, or want to request a feature!
This is an open source project and we are eager for your contribution. üéâÔ∏è

Quick Start
===========

Once you have ``django-river-ml`` installed (:ref:`getting_started-installation`) you
can do basic setup.

Setup
-----

Add it to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` along with ``rest_framework``


.. code-block:: python


    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django_river_ml',
        'rest_framework',
        ...
    )


Add django-river-ml's URL patterns:

.. code-block:: python

    from django_river_ml import urls as django_river_urls
    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        url(r'^', include(django_river_urls)),
        ...
    ]


If you use something like `Django Rest Swagger <https://django-rest-swagger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
for yur API documentation, registering the ``django_river_urls`` alongside your app should render
the endpoints nicely in the user interface! E.g., to extend the above, we might have a set of
API views (to show up in docs) and server views (to not show up):

.. code-block:: python

    from django_river_ml import urls as django_river_urls

    from rest_framework_swagger.views import get_swagger_view
    schema_view = get_swagger_view(title="Spack Monitor API")

    server_views = [
        url(r"^api/docs/", schema_view, name="docs"),
    ]

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        path("", include("django_river_ml.urls", namespace="django_river_ml")),
        url(r"^", include((server_views, "api"), namespace="internal_apis")),
        ...
    ]


And this will render the Django River ML API alongside your other API prefixes. For example,
here is Django River ML deployed under "ml":

Settings
--------

It is highly recommended that you minimally set these settings in your app settings.py
and do not use the default of the plugin:

.. list-table:: Title
   :widths: 25 25 25 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Default
     - Description
     - Example
   * - ``APP_DIR``
     - $root
     - Base directory for storing secrets and cache. Defaults to the root of the module installation (recommended to change)
     - ``os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))``
   * - ``SHELVE_SECRET_KEY``
     - None
     - Secret key for shelve (if ``STORAGE_BACKEND`` set to "shelve" (will be generated if not found)
     - fgayudsiushfdsfdf
   * - ``JWT_SECRET_KEY``
     - None
     - Secret key for json web tokens (if authentication enabled, and will be generated if not found)
     - fgayudsiushfdsfdf


The following additonal settings are available to set in your ``settings.py``:


.. list-table:: Title
   :widths: 25 25 25 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Default
     - Description
     - Example
   * - ``URL_PREFIX``
     - api
     - The api prefix to use for the endpoint
     - river
   * - ``STORAGE_BACKEND``
     - shelve
     - The storage backend to use, either shelve or redis (requires redis setup)
     - redis
   * - ``REDIS_DB``
     - river-redis
     - The redis database name, only used if ``STORAGE_BACKEND`` is set to redis
     - another-name
   * - ``REDIS_HOST``
     - localhost
     - The redis host name, only used if ``STORAGE_BACKEND`` is set to redis
     - redis-container
   * - ``REDIS_PORT``
     - 6379
     - The redis port, only used if ``STORAGE_BACKEND`` is set to redis
     - 1111
   * - ``CACHE_DIR``
     - None (and then is set to ``os.path.join(APP_DIR, "cache")``)
     - The cache directory for tokens, recommended to set a custom ``APP_DIR`` and it will be a sub-directory ``cache`` there
     - /opt/cache
   * - ``GENERATE_IDENTIFIERS``
     - True
     - Always generate identifiers for predictions. If False, you can still provide an identifier to the predict endpoint to use.
     - True
   * - ``DISABLE_AUTHENTICATION``
     - True
     - For views that require authentication, disable them.
     - True
   * - ``DOMAIN_URL``

     - Domain used in templates, and api prefix
     - https://ml-server
   * - ``SESSION_EXPIRES_SECONDS``
     - 600
     - The number of seconds a session (upload request) is valid (10 minutes)
     - 6000

     - False


For more advanced settings like customizing the endpoints with authentication, see
the `settings.py <https://github.com/vsoch/django-river-ml/blob/main/django_river_ml/settings.py>`_ in the application.

Custom Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Django River ML has support for custom models, where a custom model is one you've defined in your application
to use with river. In order for this to work, you will need to define your model somewhere
in your app so it is importable across Django apps (e.g., and when Django River ML tries to unpickle
a model object of that type, it will be found). If needed, we can further define a custom
set of classes in settings that can be looked for via importlib, however the simple
approch to define it in your app or otherwise install a module that makes it importable is
suggested.

Custom models currently support stats but not metrics, and metrics could be supported
if we think about how to go about it. the ``CustomModel`` flavor is designed to be mostly
forgiving to allow you to choose any prediction function you might have, and we can extend this
if needed.


Authentication
--------------

If you have ``DISABLE_AUTHENTICATION`` set to true, or you customize the settings ``AUTHENTICATED_VIEWS`` to change
the defaults, then you shouldn't need to do any kind of authentication. This might be ideal for a development or
closed environment that is only accessible to you or your team. However, for most cases you are strongly encouraged to
have authentication. Authentication will require creating a user, to which Django River ML will add a token generated
by Django Restful, if not already generated. For purposes of example, we can quickly create a user as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    python manage.py createsuperuser
    Username (leave blank to use 'dinosaur'):
    Email address: 
    Password: 
    Password (again): 
    Superuser created successfully.

And at this point, you can also ask for the token.

.. code-block:: console

    python manage.py get_token dinosaur
    Enter Password:
    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

You can then export this token in the environment to be found by the `river api client <https://github.com/vsoch/riverapi>`_.

.. code-block:: console

    export RIVER_ML_USER=dinosaur
    export RIVER_ML_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


Otherwise you will need to manually go through a standard OAuth2 workflow of using basic
auth to look for a 401 response with a ``Www-Authenticate`` header, parsing that to find the "realm" 
(the authentication server) and then making a request to that endpoint with the base64 encoded user and token 
in the Authenticate header. It's much easier to use the client to do it for you, which will cache your token
(until it expires and you need to request a new one automatically).

Of course if you have a Django interface with OAuth for login, you can make a settings
or profile page to easily retrieve the same token. Open an issue if you need guidance to do this.
We might consider adding a front-end view to provide by default if it's desired.

Sample Application
------------------

An `example app <https://github.com/vsoch/django-river-ml/tree/main/tests>`_ is provided that
you can use to test. Once you have your environment setup, you can do:


.. code-block:: console

    $ python manage.py makemigrations
    $ python manage.py migrate
    $ python manage.py runserver
    

In another terminal, you can then run a sample script:

    
.. code-block:: console

    $ python examples/regression/run.py
    $ python examples/binary/run.py
    $ python examples/multiclass/run.py
    $ python examples/cluster/run.py
    $ python examples/custom/run.py


Testing
-------

Running tests with the example server is also fairly easy!

.. code-block:: console

    python runtests.py


This library is under development and we will have more endpoints and functionality
coming soon!
